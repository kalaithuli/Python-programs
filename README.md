# Slide

The popular and nostalgic; slide the number into order, puzzle implementation using python on pygame module, which I made as my 1st sem project.

## How does a slide puzzle work?!

Most sliding puzzles are two-dimensional. The pieces cannot be lifted out of the frame or rearranged in any way, except by sliding them into an empty space. They are also called sliding-block puzzles or simply sliders. The goal of a sliding puzzle is to arrange the pieces in a particular pattern.
Have fun :)
